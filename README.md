# Library Tracker

## Introduction
Welcome to my Library project from TheOdinProject full stack JS path. I wanted this to be a project that I made where the page function as best as possible, with very little reoccuring errors. And I feel like I accomplished this, I had many errors at the start of this project and I fixed all the ones that I had found. The dark mode, add, update, and delete functions all work as intended, and for this project I have finally formatted for mobile and tablet. However, I have noticied issues with the tablet format and will loop back to this later. This was a very fun project and was a good challenge to not only put my design on the screen but also challenge myself to not leave holes in my code. I hope whoever tries it enjoys and that it works properly.
